# fundraising_data_pull

## What does this do?
This script takes a table of charities and creates 2 tables with data from the justgiving api:

current_fundraisers.csv will contain all the fundraisers for all of the charities
- Note that the column "Link" gives the URL for the fundraisers themselves

current_donations.csv will contain all the donations to the fundraisers

It also creates 2 all_* files that increase in size every time you run the script - this is to capture data changes and to retain data from expired pages (which can't be accessed through the api).

The charities that this script uses (in effective_charities.csv) are all recommended by one or more organisations associated with effective alturism:
https://www.givewell.org/
https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/
https://ea-foundation.org/
https://animalcharityevaluators.org/

## How do I make it run?

You will first need to register a justgiving api here (https://developer.justgiving.com/). This will provide you with an app id.
Create a file called my_app_id.R with the following contents (include the slash, do not include the brackets):

my_app_id <- {/your app id}
